Welcome to introduction to Data Visualization lesson.


**  This course is intended for  data analyst, data scientist, and other data professional.**


And I'm excited to be your instructor for next lessons.



Now , Let's begin with explaining  what is Visualization 

Visualization allow us Visual access to huge amounts of data in clear and easy way


So Data Visualization is so important and we can defined it as 


(((( Representing your data in pictorial form , such as graph, bar diagrams or any kind of charts ))))




-------


>  Slide (3) + (4)



## As prerequisite knowledge :


For this course, students should be comfortable with basic experience in data analysis in 


  1. Statistics such as 

- Calculating measures of center (mean, median, mode).

- Calculating measures of spread (Range, standard deviation).


  2. Also be familiar with analyzing data with Tableau . 



-------------------------------

>  Slide (5)


Our goals and  Advantages  we will gain from this lesson are :



- Using data visualization to communicate our findings more effectively.

- Create and apply proper graph using Tableau.

- Draw attention to your insight by using data.



-------------------------------

>  Slide (6)


And by the end of this lesson, you will be able to understand:

- Why using data visualization when we have summary statistic?

- How to choose appropriate plot for data visualization?

- How to draw attention to our insight by using data?




## (( And Now , let  walk  through the lessons step by step to study together Data Visualization ))

---------------------



>  Slide (7)

## First question is :  Why using data visualization when we have summary statistic?




The Simple answer is :  because summary statistic don't tell the full story , and I can approve that using this article
 
 
When press on the link
 
 
 
  
We can see how the expert find  that 

The Standard deviation and the mean can be great for attempting to quickly understand aspect of the dataset ,but they can also be misleading if we make many assumptions about how the data distribution looks



Now this example known as **Anscombeâ€™s Quartet** where we can find same summary statistic with different visualizations


Actually you can also see how the correlation is totally different , negative one and other is positive with same  summary statistic.



So ,  summary statistic can not tell the full story

## Second question is : How to choose appropriate plot for data visualization? 



> **Thats depend on Understand the problem and its dataset**



so  we need to know  two main point :

- know your data type : is it text or number ... etc

And 

- Know How many variable we need to analysis at single plot : is it Univariate study or maybe Multivariate study or multiple variable 


## This Question will be more clear after going through our project 


----------------------



>  Slide (9)


## third  question is : How to draw attention to our insight by using data? 



By Using Tableau for building interactive data visualizations which helping us in explore and explain our project.



> **And I will begin now display this idea by implement project in Tableau to show you how to use it in telling story**




--------------------


> Here is our tool **tableau** and now let me give you a brief idea about:


   why using tableau to visualize data , when we can use **excel , R, python????**



- **First excel** , as we can see it need skills for connecting sheets together **(Vlookup , Match , Index)**

     and the filter we need to make data validation or using pivot table and if we have huge amount of data it will consume time and give slow result 


- **R, python** : need to know code which is not easy to many non programming student 



> **But tableau is flexible tool** and we can use it without need to know code or many function and that allow users to spend more time in work in analysis more than programming 


----------------------


> **And Now , enough metod let's work in real project**




----------------------


>  Slide (10)


- **In this project,** You will create three visualizations to explore insights to help us understand  and explain our data set about COVID-19 .

-  This data comes from a Google Sheet document that was being continuously cleaned and updated by Tableau daily (see this page for details).


-  Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and effective communication

> **Now go back to slide to have quick quiz**

.

--------------------------------------------

>  Slide (11)


- A Tableau Workbook can contain multiple data sources from different source systems?


I wish you remember  our fist
