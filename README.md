## Overview



Nowadays, road safety research provides an important support for the transport policy. This type of research is concerned with meeting road casualty reduction targets in a country. In order to meet this primary objective, research is commissioned to analyze and understand various vehicle accident types and the factors influencing it. The most common types of accidents are single vehicle collisions, rear-end collisions, head-on collisions, and side impact accidents. Therefore, there has been an increasing demand for more up to date information on reported traffic accidents to be made available to researchers. As a result, in many countries, a department for transport (DfT) is responsible for collecting and publishing traffic accidents data. 



## Goals


In this TMA youâ€™re required to help researchers and implement a Vehicle Accident Application to keep track of accidents data.
